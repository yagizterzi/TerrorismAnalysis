# Terrorism Hotspots - StrataScratch Data Project

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to the **"Terrorism Hotspots"** data project from [StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/data-projects/terrorism-hotspots). The project focuses on analyzing terrorist activities across different regions, identifying trends, and visualizing key insights.

## Dataset
is an extract from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) - an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

## Notebook Contents
The Jupyter Notebook (`TerrorismAnalysis.ipynb`) provides:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis between incidents and casualties
- Visualization of attack locations and trends over time
- Identification of common attack methods and regional differences

## Installation & Requirements
To run this notebook locally, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly.express bar_chart_race
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <[repository-ur](https://github.com/yagizterzi/TerrorismAnalysis)>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd terrorism-hotspots
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TerrorismAnalysis.ipynb
   ```

## Results & Insights
The analysis provides valuable insights into global terrorism patterns, such as:
- The correlation between the number of incidents and casualties
- Regional variations in attack methods
- Time-based trends in terrorist activities
